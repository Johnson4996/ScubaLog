# ScubaLog

ScubaLog is a React application I created that allows SCUBA divers to log their dives digitally. 

# Features!

  - Allows the user to view their 5 most recent dives on the dashboard
  - User can also view these 5 dives marked on the map
  - Users have the ability to add and delete items from a wishlist on the dashboard
  - Users can view a dive that they've created. they are also able to create a new one, or edit an existing one. 


### Tech

Other than React, ScubaLog only uses the Google Maps API to function.
